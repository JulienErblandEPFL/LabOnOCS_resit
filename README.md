# MITM Attack Automation Toolkit – Group 29 
This project was developed as part of the 2IC80 Lab on Offensive Computer Security. It implements a modular and scriptable tool for launching **ARP poisoning** and **DNS spoofing** attacks in a virtual network environment using Python and Scapy. > ⚠️ This tool is for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. --- 
## 🧰 Features 
- **ARP Spoofing**: Places the attacker in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) position between selected victims and the gateway. - Supports multiple targets. - Includes Normal MITM and Anonymous SMITM modes. - Customizable spoofing interval. - Automatic ARP table restoration on exit. 
- **DNS Spoofing**: Intercepts DNS queries and responds with forged answers based on a user-defined domain-to-IP mapping. - No need to win race conditions thanks to MITM position. - Built with NetfilterQueue for real-time packet manipulation. - Includes live logging and clean teardown logic. --- 
## ⚙️ Requirements 
- Python 3.6+ 
- Linux system with root privileges 
- The following Python dependencies: 
- `scapy==2.2.0` 
- `netfilterqueue` 
Install dependencies with: ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` --- 

## 🚀 How to Use 
1. Run `main.py` as root: ```bash sudo python3 main.py ``` 
2. Select the network interface and scan the network. 
3. Choose one or multiple targets and gateway. 
4. Start ARP spoofing or ARP + DNS spoofing. 
5. Provide domains to spoof and the fake IPs. 
6. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. ARP tables will be automatically restored. ---
